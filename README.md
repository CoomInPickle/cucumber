## Overview

Cucumber is a personal Discord bot wich i want to use for all kind of things like music since there is no good one wich is reliable.
Also im gonna use it for other helpful stuff but il decide on that later
## To-Do List

- [x] Add music playback feature
- [ ] Create dynamic /help command
- [ ] /queue command to list quque or clear and maybe more
- [ ] Docker compose deployable
- [ ] !update command wich will make the but pull new files from github
- [ ] Adjustable music quality trought .env
- [ ] function to make a dedicated "console chat" for the bot either trough dm from only x user or only in the server x channel y.
      This can maybe include logging but mainly certain commands like !sync and maybe stuff that changes perrmanently to the .env
      mainly because idk how to do permission roles riight now. if i do its gonna be like /gamerula in minecraft lol
- [ ] Make Embeds always same lenght and meybe height, also change color to cucumber color
- [ ] Stop Stuttering when bot is searching song whiles playing
- [ ] Performance (its good but could be better as always)
